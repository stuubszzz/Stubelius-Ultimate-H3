"""
Muse Minimax Director — an all-in-one timeline-driven Director node for MiniMax H3,
matching MuseDirectorSamplerV10Final's own philosophy: take the real models as inputs
(so they stay fully swappable upstream — this node never loads a checkpoint itself),
run the whole pipeline internally, hand back ready-to-use frames + audio. Outputs raw
IMAGE + AUDIO (not the newer VIDEO type) so it wires straight into a standard Video
Combine node, same as the rest of this project's other Director workflows.

Internally this chains exactly the nodes the official H3 reference template uses,
verified against the real source (comfy_extras/nodes_minimax_h3.py) rather than
guessed: conditioning via MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo or MiniMaxH3ImageToVideo depending
on mode, MiniMaxH3SigmaShift on the model, RandomNoise -> BasicGuider -> KSamplerSelect
-> BasicScheduler -> SamplerCustomAdvanced -> VAEDecode + VAEDecodeAudio.

Two real, confirmed facts worth being explicit about:
  - There is no negative/CFG conditioning anywhere in H3's own reference pipeline — it
    uses BasicGuider, which only ever takes one conditioning input. That's not a gap
    in this node, it's how the model is actually set up to run.
  - Both conditioning nodes build a joint audio+video latent internally regardless of
    mode, so audio_vae is required for final decode in both Reference and First/Last
    Frame mode, even though First/Last Frame mode never encodes reference audio.

Resolution matches the real ResolutionSelector node exactly (aspect_ratio x megapixels,
rounded to `multiple`) rather than a fixed table, since H3 documents six real supported
aspect ratios, not just 16:9.

CHUNKING: H3 is only trained/reliable up to ~15s per call (its own node source flags
longer as untested). Same situation the LTX Director's own chunking system existed to
solve — that was never native to LTX either, it was Muse's own orchestration on top.
Ported here the same way: split the requested total duration into chunk_duration_seconds
pieces (the final chunk absorbs whatever's left over, so it may be shorter — chunks are
NOT evenly redistributed, so a 10s chunk size actually gives 10s chunks, not some other
number), run one real H3 call per chunk, and carry continuity from chunk to chunk.

In Reference mode, continuity is two-pronged, both confirmed against the real
MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo node source rather than assumed:
  - Video: `ref_videos` accepts up to 3 reference *clips*, not just a still frame, so
    continuation chunks feed the previous chunk's own output back in as a reference
    video (slot 0, reserved) alongside any character/background images.
  - Audio: the previous chunk's own decoded audio (last ~4s) is fed back in too, via
    `ref_audios` slot 0 — otherwise each chunk invents its own score/ambience from
    scratch with zero awareness of what the previous chunk sounded like, producing an
    audible hard reset between chunks (observed directly in an early test render).
Both carried-over references get an explicit instruction appended to the prompt telling
the model to continue seamlessly (no cut, no new piece of music) rather than treating
the carry-over clips as just more generic reference material — a bare reference without
that instruction doesn't reliably read as "keep going from here" on its own.

First/Last Frame mode doesn't have a reference-clip mechanism at all, so its
continuation falls back to the previous chunk's last decoded frame as the next chunk's
first_frame, same idea as LTX's carry-frame (no equivalent audio carry-over exists for
this mode either — that model variant never encodes reference audio at all).

CUT blocks in the timeline are a prompt-authoring convenience (H3 has no chunk concept
in its own single-call architecture) — but they now double as the chunk-bucketing input:
each CUT's proportional position along the total duration decides which real chunk call
it gets compiled into, based on its own start time crossing a chunk boundary.

    meant to be exactly what renders as separate H3 calls.

    "for them — use only what actually fits the brief, never force one in:\n\n"
    "- Kinetic transitions: for brand films, titles, or motion-graphics briefs, prefer specific "
    "transition language over generic 'cut to' — e.g. cut at peak motion blur, whip-pan with "
    "smear, rack focus, flash-to-white, iris/mask-locked framing that stays fixed while only the "
    "image inside it moves, vinyl-record circular wipes, vertical car-door cuts, long-shadow "
    "wipes, oversized letter masks, tiled frames snapping into place.\n"
    "- Exact on-screen text: if the brief specifies text/wording that must appear verbatim (a "
    "title, slogan, sign), quote it exactly in detailed_description and state plainly that no "
    "other readable text may appear. If text tends to render garbled, describe it as coming from "
    "a reference image rather than being generated as text.\n"
    "- Style guardrails: for genre-specific or period-specific briefs (period drama, horror-"
    "adjacent, sci-fi, otome/anime), add a short explicit 'do not' list to keep the aesthetic "
    "controlled — e.g. no modern elements, no oversmoothed skin, no jump scares, no gore — rather "
    "than relying on the positive description alone to exclude drift.\n"
    "- Camera language: describe moves as motion type + amplitude + speed (push in / pull back / "
    "arc around / whip-pan, small or large amplitude, slow or fast) — never vague adjectives like "
    "'dynamic' or 'cinematic camera work' alone.\n"
    "- Sound design: tie specific foley beats to specific visual beats rather than generic "
    "ambience — e.g. 'ice taps the glass once,' 'a spoon clinks against the cup' — matched to a "
    "moment in detailed_description, not just listed loosely in overall_soundscape.\n"
    "- <Video N> references (when present) are for matching motion, camera movement, or editing "
    "the same clip in place — never write instructions implying a video reference should make the "
    "Subject continue or repeat an action from a previous clip; the last-frame <Picture N> anchor "
    "handles continuation instead.\n"
